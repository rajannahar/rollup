# Rollup JS

* /src/modules/ - contains modular js files (exports)

* /src/output/output1.js - imports the modular js files

* in CLI 'npm run build' - build this to /js/bundle.js which is the final product

# needs babel or js compiler to transpile to js so compatible in browsers 
* Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token export - this error is currently experienced as browsers do not support ES6
